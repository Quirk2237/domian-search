# Domain Quality Checklist

This document defines our criteria for excellent domain names. It serves as the source of truth for evaluating domain suggestions and is used by our AI evaluation system to improve suggestion quality over time.

## Core Requirements (Must Have)

### 1. Length ✓
- **Ideal**: 4-10 characters (before TLD)
- **Acceptable**: 11-12 characters if highly brandable
- **Avoid**: 13+ characters (too long for memorability)

### 2. Spelling & Pronunciation ✓
- Must pass the "radio test" (clear when spoken aloud)
- No ambiguous spellings (e.g., "4" vs "for", "u" vs "you")
- Avoid consecutive vowels or consonants that are hard to pronounce
- International friendly (works across languages/accents)

### 3. Technical Requirements ✓
- No hyphens or underscores
- No numbers (unless integral to brand like "23andme")
- Starts with a letter (better for social media handles)
- No special characters

### 4. Availability ✓
- Must be available for registration
- Consider trademark conflicts for common terms

## Highly Desirable Features

### 5. TLD Strategy
- **.com** strongly preferred (3.8x more likely to be typed directly)
- Alternative TLDs acceptable if:
  - Perfect keyword match (.ai for AI companies)
  - Short and memorable (.io for tech)
  - Brand enhancing (.app for applications)
- **Avoid**: Obscure TLDs unless exceptional fit

### 6. Brandability Score

## Bonus Criteria

### 9. Future-Proofing
- Won't sound dated in 5-10 years
