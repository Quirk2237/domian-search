DOMAIN EXCELLENCE FRAMEWORK
What Makes a Domain Valuable (weighted scoring):

Brandability (26%) - Can it become a household name?
Industry Relevance (15%) - Does it connect to the business type?
Memorability (15%) - Will people remember it after hearing once?
Pronounceability (15%) - Can it spread by word-of-mouth?
Emotional Resonance (15%) - Does it evoke positive feelings?
Growth Potential (14%) - Can it scale beyond initial use?

Industry Relevance Criteria:
• Contextual Fit - Domain clearly relates to the identified industry
• Value Proposition Alignment - Reflects what the business offers
• Audience Resonance - Appeals to target customers of that industry
• Competitive Positioning - Stands out in the specific market

The $10K+ Domain Formula:

Length: 4-8 characters = premium, 9-12 = excellent, 13+ = declining value
Sound: Starts with plosive (P,B,T,D,K,G) or smooth flow (L,M,N,R)
Rhythm: 1-3 syllables with natural stress patterns
Meaning: Either purely abstract OR metaphorically perfect
Typing: No ambiguous letters (l/I, 0/O), easy on mobile

ADVANCED NAMING TECHNIQUES
1. THE PERFECT DESCRIPTION METHOD (25%)
Sometimes the best domain simply says what it does:

InstantDomainSearch.com - immediately clear purpose
HotelTonight.com - book hotels for tonight
RentTheRunway.com - rent designer clothes
StitchFix.com - fixes your wardrobe

When to use: When the descriptive domain IS the brand differentiator
Key: Must be short enough to type and memorable despite being descriptive
2. THE METAPHOR METHOD (25%)
Find unexpected parallels to the app's purpose:

Uber (transportation) = "above/beyond" in German
Amazon (bookstore) = massive river/jungle
Apple (computers) = simple, approachable fruit

For your app, think: What represents "finding/discovering" without saying it?
3. THE SOUND SYMBOLISM METHOD (20%)
Use phonemes that psychologically match the brand:

Sharp sounds (K,T,P) = precision, technology
Smooth sounds (L,M,S) = flow, ease
Open vowels (A,O) = expansive, welcoming

4. THE PORTMANTEAU PLUS METHOD (20%)
Blend words but make it non-obvious:

Groupon = Group + Coupon (obvious but works)
Pinterest = Pin + Interest (clever blend)
Microsoft = Microcomputer + Software (dated but worked)

Better: Blend partial words or sounds, not full words
5. THE LINGUISTIC INVENTION METHOD (10%)
Create words that follow language rules but don't exist:

Spotify: Spot + -ify (verb-making suffix)
Shopify: Shop + -ify
Kodak: Completely invented but follows English phonotactics

AVAILABILITY STRATEGIES (Without Sacrificing Quality)
The Sweet Spot Rules:

One letter off from common: Change ONE letter in familiar words

Lyft (Lift), Flickr (Flicker), Tumblr (Tumbler)


Unexpected combinations: Pair words that rarely meet

Face + Book = Facebook (who would have thought?)
Snap + Chat = Snapchat (verb + verb unusual)


Foreign language mining: Use non-English words

Vevo (Latin: "I live")
Hulu (Mandarin: "precious things")
Nokia (Finnish river)


Invented but linguistic: Follow phonological rules

Xerox, Kodak, Exxon (feel like words but aren't)



CATEGORY-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
For "AI-powered domain tool", you have two paths:
Path A: Descriptive Excellence

NameCheckAI.com, DomainFinderPro.com, InstantNameSearch.com
Clear function + benefit (instant, check, find)
Under 20 characters total for memorability

Path B: Abstract Brand

Discovery metaphors (compass, map, guide - but abstracted)
Creation metaphors (forge, craft, build - but transformed)
Vision metaphors (lens, prism, scope - but modified)

Sound Patterns for Both:

Technical precision: hard consonants (K,T,X,Z)
Innovation: rising intonation (end with -a, -o)
Reliability: balanced syllables

DYNAMIC CATEGORY ADAPTATION
Instead of fixed categories, analyze each query for:
• Core business function (what it does)
• Value proposition (why it matters)
• Target audience (who it serves)
• Industry context (where it operates)

Then apply relevant naming patterns:
• Action-oriented businesses → verb-based domains (AutomateNow, FlowForge)
• Innovation businesses → future-forward names (NextGen, FutureScope)
• Trust-based services → reliability-focused names (SecureVault, TrustPilot)
• Creative businesses → imaginative, artistic names (PixelDream, ArtisanForge)

Examples by detected context:
• Automation context → FlowPilot.com, TaskForge.io, AutomateOne.com
• AI/Tech context → DataPrism.ai, NeuralFlow.io, ByteWise.com
• E-commerce context → ShopSphere.com, MarketPulse.io, DealForge.com
• Service context → ExpertHub.com, ProAssist.io, ServiceFlow.com

THE MULTI-TIER APPROACH
Tier 1: Premium Options (Mix of both types)
Create 4 domains that could sell for $50K+:

2 Perfect descriptive domains (InstantDomainSearch style)
2 Premium brandables (Stripe, Canva style)

Tier 2: Excellent Niche Brands
Create 4 domains worth $5-10K in your specific niche:

Clear connection to purpose
Mix of descriptive and abstract
Growth potential

Tier 3: Solid Starters
Create 2 domains that are immediately usable:

Good enough to build on
Available with common TLDs
Won't limit future growth

QUALITY FILTERS
Each domain must pass:

The Industry Test: Does someone in this field immediately "get it"?
The Context Test: Does it make sense for this specific business?
The Starbucks Test: Could this be a global brand?
The Radio Test: Can you spell it from hearing it?
The Investor Test: Would someone pay 100x registration for it?
The Mom Test: Can your mom remember and spell it?
The Global Test: Works across cultures?

AVOID THESE AVAILABILITY KILLERS

Single dictionary words (unless truly unique angle)
Overly generic descriptions (BestDomains, GreatNames)
Trendy prefixes (Get-, My-, The-, i-) without purpose
Trendy suffixes (-ly, -ify, -hub, -lab) unless they add meaning
Category + Tech/AI/Pro/Plus (unless it truly fits)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Generate 10 domains with this distribution:

6 .com domains (require maximum creativity)
2 .io domains (tech-focused options)
1 .app domain (if mobile-relevant)
1 .ai domain (only if NOT AI-descriptive)

For each domain explain:

The creation method used
Why it's memorable/valuable
The emotional/conceptual connection

EXAMPLES OF EXCELLENCE + AVAILABILITY
Great DESCRIPTIVE domains:

InstantDomainSearch.com (domain tool - perfect clarity)
ConvertKit.com (email marketing - action + result)
MailChimp.com (email - function + memorable mascot)
QuickBooks.com (accounting - speed + function)

Great BRANDABLE domains:

Notion.so (note-taking app, clean concept)
Stripe.com (payment processing, simple metaphor)
Canva.com (design tool, modified "canvas")
Asana.com (project management, yoga term)

Notice: Both types can build billion-dollar companies.
